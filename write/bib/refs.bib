  abstract = {In this detailed history of the Chicago School of Sociology, Andrew Abbott investigates central topics in the emergence of modern scholarship, paying special attention to "schools of science" and how such schools reproduce themselves over time. What are the preconditions from which schools arise? Do they exist as rigid rules or as flexible structures? How do they emerge from the day-to-day activities of academic life such as editing journals and writing papers? Abbott analyzes the shifts in social scientific inquiry and discloses the intellectual rivalry and faculty politics that characterized different stages of the Chicago School. Along the way, he traces the rich history of the discipline's main journal, the American Journal of Sociology. Embedded in this analysis of the school and its practices is a broader theoretical argument, which Abbott uses to redefine social objects as a sequence of interconnected events rather than as fixed entities. Abbott's theories grow directly out of the Chicago School's insistence that social life be located in time and place, a tradition that has been at the heart of the school since its founding one hundred years ago.},

After considering the scientific implications of non-reproducible methods, we provide a review of both open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and openly available data, before describing an integrated model for Open GISc.

In this article, we situate one branch of Big Data analytics, spatial Big Data, through a historical predecessor, geodemographic analysis, to help develop a critical approach to current data analytics. Spatial Big Data promises an epistemic break in marketing, a leap from targeting geodemographic areas to targeting individuals. Yet it inherits characteristics and problems from geodemographics, including a justification through the market, and a process of commodification through the black-boxing of technology. As researchers develop sustained critiques of data analytics and its effects on everyday life, we must so with a grounding in the cultural and historical contexts from which data technologies emerged. This article and others (Barnes and Wilson, 2014) develop a historically situated, critical approach to spatial Big Data. This history illustrates connections to the critical issues of surveillance, redlining, and the production of consumer subjects and geographies. The shared histories and structural logics of spatial Big Data and geodemographics create the space for a continued critique of data analyses? role in society.},

  abstract = {The 2011 Area Classification for Output Areas (2011 OAC) is a new open geodemographic classification of the UK based on 2011 UK Census data. The 2011 OAC, created in partnership with the Office for National Statistics (ONS), supersedes the 2001 Area Classification for Output Areas (2001 OAC) to provide the most current open geodemographic view of the UK. The 2001 OAC was widely used in academia, local government and by commercial organisations, but its reliance on data from the 2001 UK Census has led to a perceived degradation of reliability over time and a decline in users. The release of the 2011 UK Census data provided the opportunity to create a 2011 OAC which could address some of the acknowledged flaws of the 2001 OAC, such as the methods used for data handling, to create a more robust methodology. The publication of this methodology with accompanying documentation, in addition to utilising open-source software, guarantees the reproducibility of the 2011 OAC; with an additional benefit of the methodology being able to act as a template for future bespoke open geodemographic classifications. Open geodemographic classifications, unlike those provided by commercial organisations, have historically been unable to utilise ancillary data sources to enrich and update their systems. This research proposes an alternative approach; utilising the limited range of Open Data sources made available regularly at the small granular level to create uncertainty indicators. These indicators allow areas of uncertainty that develop over time within the classification's geodemographic assignment to be identified; allowing users the opportunity to take compensatory action. This project delivered a new open geodemographic classification of the UK. The methodological advances, use of open source software and ability to assess the temporal stability of geodemographic assignments mean the 2011 OAC can be considered a step forward for open geodemographics.},

The classification places each 2001 census output area into one of seven clusters based on the socio-economic attributes of the residents of each area. The classification uses cluster analysis to reduce 41 census variables to a single socio-economic indicator. The classification was made available with a host of supporting and descriptive information as a National Statistic via National Statistics on line. The classification forms part of a suite of area classifications that were produced by the Office for National Statistics from 2001 census data. Classifications of local authorities, statistical wards and health areas are also available.},

Several methods were applied including kernel density estimation, global autocorrelations, sigma-convergence detection, and hierarchical clustering. The results demonstrated that the spatial distribution of IUP at the country level showed significant positive autocorrelations indicating clustered spatial patterns rather than dispersed or random distributions. In addition, the temporal variation of the distribution disparity of IUP showed a decreasing trend at the country level during the study period. Further, sigma convergence of IUP during this period was detected according to the coefficient of variation. Last, the similarity of the IUP variation at the country level presented the spatial clustering feature with spatially contiguous countries in the world. In sum, the finding in this study indicated that Internet penetration may show the promotion of the balanced development trend over time in the world and the spatial characteristics of Internet development should be considered in the future policy globally.},

Plenty of books describe what agile development is or why it helps software projects succeed, but very few combine information for developers, managers, testers, and customers into a single package that they can apply directly.This book provides no-nonsense advice on agile planning, development, delivery, and management taken from the authors' many years of experience with Extreme Programming (XP). You get a gestalt view of the agile development process, including comprehensive guidance for non-technical readers and hands-on technical practices for developers and testers.The Art of Agile Development gives you clear answers to questions such as:How can we adopt agile development?Do we really need to pair program?What metrics should we report?What if I can't get my customer to participate?How much documentation should we write?When do we design and architect?As a non-developer, how should I work with my agile team?Where is my product roadmap?How does QA fit in?The book teaches you how to adopt XP practices, describes each practice in detail, then discusses principles that will allow you to modify XP and create your own agile method. In particular, this book tackles the difficult aspects of agile development: the need for cooperation and trust among team members.Whether you're currently part of an agile team, working with an agile team, or interested in agile development, this book provides the practical tips you need to start practicing agile development. As your experience grows, the book will grow with you, providing exercises and information that will teach you first to understand the rules of agile development, break them, and ultimately abandon rules altogether as you master the art of agile development."Jim Shore and Shane Warden expertly explain the practices and benefits of Extreme Programming. They offer advice from their real-world experiences in leading teams. They answer questions about the practices and show contraindications - ways that a practice may be mis-applied. They offer alternatives you can try if there are impediments to applying a practice, such as the lack of an on-site customer.--Ken Pugh, Author of Jolt Award Winner, Prefactoring"I will leave a copy of this book with every team I visit."--Brian Marick, Exampler Consulting},

  abstract = {The urbanization of the world, which is one of the most impressive facts of modern times, has wrought profound changes in virtually every phase of social life. The recency and rapidity of urbanization in the United States accounts for the acuteness of our urban problems and our lack of awareness of them. Despite the dominance of urbanism in the modern world we still lack a sociological definition of the city which would take adequate account of the fact that while the city is the characteristic locus of urbanism, the urban mode of life is not confined to cities. For sociological purpose a city is a relatively large, dense, and permanent settlement of heterogenous individuals. Large numbers account for inidividual variability, the relative absence of intimate personal acquaintanceship, the segmentalization of human relations which are largely anonymous, superficial, and transitory, and associated characteristic. Density involves diversification and specialization, the coincidence of social relations, glaring contrasts, a complex pattern of segregation, the predominance of formal social control, and accentuated friction, among other phenomena. Heterogeneity tends to break down rigid social structures and to produce increased mobility, instability, and insecurity, and the affilitation of the individuals with a variety of intersecting and tangential social groups with a high rate of membership turnover. The pecuniary nexus tends to displace personal relations, institutions tend to cater to mass rather than to individual requirements. The individual thus becomes effective only as he acts through organized groups. The complicated phenomena of urbanism may acquire unity and coherence if the sociological analysis proceeds in the light of such a body of theory. The empirical evidence concerning the ecology, the social organization, and the social psychology of the urban mode of life confirms the fruitfulness of this approach.}

  abstract = {This article critically explores how the relations between information technologies and space and place are being conceptualized in a broad swathe of recent writings and discourses on the geographies of ?cyberspace? and information technologies. After analysing the powerful role of spatial and territorial metaphors in anchoring current discourses about information technologies and society, the article goes on to identify three broad, dominating perspectives. These I label the perspective of ?substitution and transcendence? (dominated by technological Utopianists), the ?co-evolution? perspective (drawing from political economy and cultural studies) and the ?recombination? perspective (derived from recent work in actor-network theory). The discussion turns to each in turn, extracting the geographical dimensions and implications of each. The article concludes by considering the implications of the discussion for spatial treatments of societytechnology relations and for broader debates about the nature of space and place.},

The authors provide an easy to understand basicintroduction to Al relevant to geography. There are no specialmathematical and statistical skills needed, indeed these might wellbe a hindrance. Al is a different way of looking at the world andit requires a willingness to experiment, and readers who areunhindered by the baggage of obsolete technologies and outmodedphilosophies of science will probably do best. The text provides anintroduction to expert systems, neural nets, genetic algorithms,smart systems and artificial life and shows how they are likely totransform geographical enquiry. * A major methodological milestone in geography * The first geographical book on artificial intelligence (Al) * No need for previous mathematical or statisticalskills/knowledge * Accessible style makes a difficult subject available to a wideaudience * Stan Openshaw is one of the world s leading researchers intogeographical computing, spatial analysis and GIS.},

  abstract = {This article describes an emergent logic of accumulation in the networked sphere, ?surveillance capitalism,? and considers its implications for ?information civilization.? The institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: data extraction and analysis,? ?new contractual forms due to better monitoring,? ?personalization and customization, ? and continuous experiments. ? An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: Big Other. ? It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates that bitcoin's medium- to long-term price follows Metcalfe's law. Bitcoin is modeled as a token digital currency, a medium of exchange with no intrinsic value that is transacted within a defined electronic network. Per Metcalfe's law, the value of a network is a function of the number of pairs transactions possible, and is proportional to n-squared. A Gompertz curve is used to model the inflationary effects associated with the creation of new bitcoin. The result is a parsimonious model of supply (number of bitcoins) and demand (number of bitcoin wallets), with the conclusion bitcoin's price fits Metcalfe's law exceptionally well. Metcalfe's law is used to investigate Gandal's et.al. [2018] assertion of price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem during 2013-2014.},

When the unit is the Census Bureau's nine geographic divisions, the correlation between illiteracy rate and per cent of Negroes is .95; when the unit is the 48 states, the correlation is .77; and when using individual correlations between color and illiteracy based upon census tabulations the correlation is .20.

  abstract = {In 1980s, Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet, proposed a formulation of network value in terms of the network size (the number of nodes of the network), which was later named as Metcalfe's law. The law states that the value V of a network is proportional to the square of the size n of the network, i.e., V {$\propto$} n2. Metcalfe's law has been influential and an embodiment of the network effect concept. It also generated many controversies. Some scholars went so far as to state ``Metcalfe's law is wrong'' and ``dangerous''. Some other laws have been proposed, including Sarnoff's law (V {$\propto$} n), Odlyzko's law (V {$\propto$} nlog(n)), and Reed's law (V {$\propto$} 2n). Despite these arguments, for 30 years, no evidence based on real data was available for or against Metcalfe's law. The situation was changed in late 2013, when Metcalfe himself used Facebook's data over the past 10 years to show a good fit for Metcalfe's law. In this paper, we expand Metcalfe's results by utilizing the actual data of Tencent (China's largest social network company) and Facebook (the world's largest social network company). Our results show that: 1) of the four laws of network effect, Metcalfe's law by far fits the actual data the best; 2) both Tencent and Facebook data fit Metcalfe's law quite well; 3) the costs of Tencent and Facebook are proportional to the squares of their network sizes, not linear; and 4) the growth trends of Tencent and Facebook monthly active users fit the netoid function well.},
